# Pacmen agent notes

Goal: 2-player co-op Pac-Man style game in C++20 using raylib on Windows.

Constraints:
- Tilemap-based logic loaded from assets/maps/level1.txt
- Two players: WASD and Arrow keys
- No sprites yet, use rectangles and circles until movement feels right
- Keep files small and organized
- Always keep the project building with CMake + vcpkg
